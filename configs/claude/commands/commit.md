description: Create a well-formatted git commit with conventional commit style
---
Review all staged changes (git diff --cached) and unstaged changes (git diff).
Create a conventional commit message following this format:
- type(scope): description
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, build, ci, perf
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add a body if the change needs explanation

Stage appropriate files and create the commit. Ask me to confirm before committing.
